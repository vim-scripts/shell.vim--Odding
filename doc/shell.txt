*shell.txt*  Improved integration between Vim and its environment

This plug-in aims to improve the integration between Vim [1] and its
environment by providing functions to switch to full-screen, open URLs in the
user's default web browser and execute external commands in the background
without opening a command prompt window. A DLL is included to perform these
things on Windows, while on UNIX external commands are used.

==============================================================================
Background

A few years ago when I was still using Windows I created a 'libcall()'
compatible DLL [2] to toggle Vim [1]'s GUI window between regular and
full-screen mode. I also added a few other useful functions, e.g. 'openurl()'
to launch the default web browser and 'execute()' which works like Vim's
'system()' function but doesn't wait for the process to finish and doesn't
open a command prompt.

Since then I switched to Linux and didn't look back, which meant the DLL sat
in my '~/.vim/etc/' waiting to be revived. Now that I've published my
easytags.vim [3] plug-in and put a lot of effort into making it Windows
compatible, the 'execute()' function from the DLL would be very useful to run
Exuberant Ctags [4] in the background without stealing Vim's focus by opening
a command prompt window. This is why I've decided to release the DLL. Because
I switched to Linux I've also added an autoload script that wraps the DLL on
Windows and calls out to external programs on UNIX (using 'wmctrl',
'gnome-open', 'kde-open', etc.)

Before I go ahead and bundle the DLL with the 'easytags.vim' plug-in I need
to make sure that the DLL is compatible with as many Windows Vim installations
out there as possible, e.g. XP/Vista/7, different service packs, 32/64 bits,
etc. and I don't know where to start! I've uploaded a ZIP archive including a
compiled DLL [5] to the Vim scripts page [6] for this plug-in (build using the
latest Windows SDK but targeting Windows XP x86 DEBUG, should also work on
Vista/7) and the source code is available in the GitHub repository [7] (see
the 'NMAKE' makefile [8] for compile instructions).

==============================================================================
Testing the plug-in

I'd be very grateful if people would test the plug-in in different
environments and report their results by contacting the 'vim_dev' mailing-list
or e-mailing me directly at peter@peterodding.com. You can test the DLL by
unpacking the ZIP archive from www.vim.org [5] in the '%USERPROFILE%\vimfiles'
directory (on Windows) or the '~/.vim/' directory (on UNIX), restarting Vim
and testing the three functions as follows from inside Vim:

1. Execute the following command:
>
        :call xolox#shell#openurl('http://www.vim.org/')

Does this open your preferred (or best available) web browser? On UNIX if the
environment variable '$DISPLAY' is empty the plug-in will switch to a
command-line browser.

2. (Windows only) Execute the following command:
>
        :call xolox#shell#execute('notepad')

Does this start Notepad without blocking Vim's window and without opening a
command prompt window to run the command?

3. In graphical Vim execute the following command:
>
        :call xolox#shell#fullscreen()

Is Vim's GUI window properly switched to full-screen mode? If so you can
return to normal mode by calling the function again. If you're stuck in
full-screen Vim, save your existing buffers and press 'Alt-F4', that should
always work.
